# Facade Pattern

>**Facade Pattern** provides a unified interface to a set of intefaces in a subsytem. Facade defines higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

- **A facade is not only simplified an interface, it decouples a client from a subsystem of components.**

- **Facades and adapters may wrap multiple classes, but facade's intent is to simplify, while an adapter's is to convert the interface to something different.**
