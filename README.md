# Design Patterns
**- implemented in Java**

### Design Principle

> Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stay the same

> Program to interface, not an implemetation

> Favor composition over inheritence

> Strive for loosely coupled designs
between objects that interact.

> Classes should be open for extensions, but closed for modification

> Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

> Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate firends.
